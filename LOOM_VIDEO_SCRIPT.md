# 3-Minute Loom Video Script
## Brewery Recipe Subscription Platform - Client Demo

---

## üé¨ OPENING (0:00 - 0:30)

"Hey there! This is [Your Name] from **NEXIS**, your global full-stack software development partner.

I'm excited to share what we've built for your Brewery Recipe Subscription Platform. In just the past two weeks, we've transformed your vision into a working, production-ready MVP that's already deployed and accepting real users.

You mentioned needing speed to market - we delivered. You wanted a subscription platform that validates your business model fast - we built it. Let me show you what we've accomplished."

"First, here's your public-facing landing page. This is what your potential customers see when they discover your platform through social media or ads.

Notice the clean, professional design with your value proposition front and center: 'AI-Powered Brewery Recipes Delivered Monthly.' We've included:
- A compelling hero section that immediately communicates the value
- Clear call-to-action buttons to subscribe
- Pricing tiers that are transparent and easy to understand
- A 'How It Works' section explaining your unique offering

This page is fully mobile-responsive and optimized for conversion tracking with Google Analytics and Meta Pixel integration."


"When users click 'Subscribe' or 'Sign Up', they're taken to a secure authentication flow powered by Supabase.


Users simply enter their name, email, and create a password. The system sends an email confirmation for security - a critical feature for protecting both you and your customers.



Once confirmed, they're automatically logged in and ready for onboarding."

"Here's where your platform gets really powerful. The onboarding questionnaire captures exactly what you need to personalize recipe delivery.


**Step 1:** Brewery size and experience level - this helps you match recipes to their capability.

**Step 2:** Equipment selection - users tell you what brewing equipment they own. This is crucial because you'll only send recipes they can actually make.

**Step 3:** Preferred beer styles - IPA lover? Stout enthusiast? The system captures their preferences.

**Step 4:** Dietary restrictions and additional notes - gluten-free brewing, vegan ingredients, special requirements.


Notice the clean progress indicator showing users exactly where they are in the process - users can complete this in under 3 minutes."

"After onboarding, users land on their personalized dashboard.

Here they can see:
- Their subscription status - active, trial, or inactive
- Their profile preferences at a glance
- The recipe library where monthly deliveries will appear
- Quick actions to manage their account or update preferences

The 'Manage Billing' button will eventually link to Stripe's customer portal, allowing users to update payment methods, upgrade plans, or cancel - all without contacting support."

"Behind the scenes, we've built a robust Stripe webhook integration handling 8 different payment events:
- Successful checkouts
- Subscription updates
- Payment failures
- Cancellations

This means when someone subscribes, upgrades, or their payment fails, your database updates automatically in real-time. You'll always have accurate subscription data without manual intervention."


"Let me break down exactly where we are:

**‚úÖ PHASE 1 - COMPLETE:**
- Full authentication system with email verification
- Production-ready database with all necessary tables
- Landing page with analytics tracking
- Security and RLS policies configured

**‚úÖ PHASE 2 - 80% COMPLETE:**
- Stripe payment integration (webhook handlers built)
- Complete user onboarding flow with 4-step questionnaire
- User dashboard with subscription display
- Profile preference management

**READY FOR PHASE 3** (Starting this week):
- AI-powered recipe matching using Google Gemini
- Automated monthly recipe delivery system
- Admin portal for uploading recipes and managing users
- Email automation for welcome sequences and monthly notifications

**TIMELINE:**
We're on track to deliver the complete, market-ready MVP in just **3 more weeks** - that's a full month from start to finish.

**THE DIFFERENCE:**
Unlike a no-code platform built on Webflow + Memberstack, you now own a custom, scalable application with:
- ‚úÖ No monthly platform fees eating into your margins
- ‚úÖ Complete customization control - add any feature you want
- ‚úÖ Professional-grade infrastructure that scales to thousands of users
- ‚úÖ Real AI integration for intelligent recipe matching
- ‚úÖ Full data ownership and export capabilities"

"Here's what I recommend:

1. Review the detailed proposal I'm sending - it includes milestone breakdowns, investment details, and our ongoing support options
2. Let's schedule a 15-minute call this week to walk through any questions
3. We'll get Phase 3 started immediately with AI recipe matching and admin portal

For just **$7,200**, you're getting a custom-built, production-ready platform that would cost $30,000+ from a traditional agency and $3,000+/month in platform fees with a no-code solution.

You wanted speed, functionality, and validation - **we're delivering all three, ahead of schedule**.

We are excited to finish this build and get your first paying customers onboarded. Check out the full proposal, and let's make this happen.

Thanks for watching - talk soon!"
