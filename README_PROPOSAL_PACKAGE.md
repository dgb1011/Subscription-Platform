## üìä Expected Client Response

### Likely Questions

**Q: "Why custom development instead of what I asked for?"**
**A**: "The cover letter addresses this extensively. Key points:
- Lower long-term costs ($7,740 Year 1 vs. $4,247-$16,772)
- More features (AI impossible with no-code)
- Better scalability (10,000+ users)
- Higher exit value (2-3x if you sell the business)"

**Q: "Can you really deliver in 4 weeks?"**
**A**: "We're already 45% done. Phases 1 & 2 are substantially complete. The remaining work is well-scoped and proven tech. Yes, we can deliver in 4 weeks."

**Q: "What if I want changes?"**
**A**: "That's the beauty of custom development. You own the code. We can add, modify, or remove any feature. No platform limitations."

**Q: "Do I have to pay all upfront?"**
**A**: "No. Milestone-based payments mean you only pay after seeing working deliverables. 30% upfront, then 30%, 25%, 15% at each milestone."

## ‚ö° Pro Tips for Winning This Project

### 1. Show, Don't Tell
The Loom video is your secret weapon. Seeing working code is infinitely more convincing than promises.

### 2. Emphasize Speed
They want this done in 2-3 weeks. You're delivering in 4 weeks with MORE features. That's still fast.

### 3. Highlight Ownership
No-code platforms lock you in. Custom development gives them freedom.

### 4. De-Risk the Decision
Milestone payments mean they can bail if unhappy. That reduces their perceived risk.

### 5. Follow Up
If no response in 48 hours, send a brief follow-up:
> "Hi [Name], just wanted to make sure you received my proposal and demo video. Happy to jump on a quick call this week to discuss. When works for you?"

- Send generic "I can do this" proposal
- Forget to attach Loom video link
- Use too much technical jargon

### ‚úÖ Do This Instead:
- Fix deployment, ensure everything works
- Record polished demo
- Send comprehensive, personalized proposal
- Include all attachments (video + presentation)
- Explain tech benefits in business terms
- Position custom dev as "better" not "different"
- Under-promise, over-deliver
